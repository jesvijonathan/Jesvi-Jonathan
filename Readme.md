#Jesvi's Portfolio Website

<b>Live Demo :</b> https://jesvi.pythonanywhere.com/
<br>
<i><b>Long story short, I wanted a webpage for myself, unique & different..<br>Tadda ! This is what i ended with.</b></i>
<br>

- It can be set up as static as well as a dynamic website

- By default it is a dynamic website with some logging, data update/fetch, etc operation.

- to make it static, remove the all the dynamic functions and it will work on a static server without any problem.<br><br>

####Set it up in servers, in few steps -

- Clone repo
- Modify
- Setup server & configuration
- Run Website
  <br>

####Requirements -

- Python
  - flask
  - flask_mail
  - google-client-api
- An optimal OS/Server
  - Windows
  - Linux, etc
    <br>

####Thoughts -

Time taken was almost a month, not consistent and thats why it took so long...

There are several libraries that can be used to achieve what i did here but this is an example of how to code in native, like everything thats displayed is native built by me from scratch (and some research xD)
